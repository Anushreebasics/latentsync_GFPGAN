# LatentSync with GFPGAN Super-Resolution

This repository demonstrates how to integrate GFPGAN super-resolution into the [LatentSync](https://github.com/bytedance/LatentSync) lipsync pipeline. The integration automatically applies GFPGAN enhancement to the generated video frames only when their resolution is lower than the original input video frames.
